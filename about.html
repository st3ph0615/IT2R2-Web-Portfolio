                    Hi, I'm Stephanie! I’m a web designer with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly designs using Figma. 
                    I specialize in crafting clean, intuitive websites and apps that not only look stunning but also offer a seamless user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to design, I have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS, allowing me to bring my designs to life with well-structured, responsive layouts. 
                    This helps ensure that the transition from design to development is smooth and efficient.
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that great design should be simple, functional, and enjoyable for everyone. If you're looking for a designer who understands both aesthetics and usability, 
                    I’d love to collaborate with you! Feel free to reach out—let’s bring your ideas to life.
